# ChipAight

A minimal Chip8 emulator in C

## Building

You might have to change the compiler path for your specific system.

To build the emulator run 

```
make build
```

## TODO:
 - [X] Be able to somewhat run a bin
 - [ ] Add a proper display (probably SDL2)
 - [ ] Add the bit fonts
 - [ ] Make some test bin to check instruction implementations
 - [ ] There are still some OPs missing
 - [ ] Documentation (lmao)
 - [ ] Fix timers to tick at 60hz
 - [ ] Cmdline arguments
 - [ ] Proper logging
